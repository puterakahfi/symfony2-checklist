Check the production server
basis
Before deploying your application, you have to test that your production server is ready to run it.

To test your server you have the choice between three methods:

1. Manually run `php app/check.php` and see what to resolve;
2. Access the `config.php` with your browser, located in the `web` directory;
3. If you don't have access to your server yet (you're planning to buy it), you can still go to the [documentation reference page](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements.html)
